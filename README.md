# kapy-exif

This is a simple library that extracts and replaces EXIF data in an image file. It focuses on the minimal functionalities required by the Kapy application, and therefore, it might be difficult to use for general purposes.

The functionalities this library focuses on are as follows:

- Extracting raw EXIF data from an image (currently, JPEG and HEIC images are supported)
- Adding or replacing raw EXIF data for an image
